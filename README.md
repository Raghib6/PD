# PD

1) I imported few library and modules such as numpy,random.

2) Created an empty list named i_time for interarrival time and another list a_time with an integer value 0 in it.

3) Used a for loop of range(20) and randint() function with a range of 1 to 21 to get a list of random value.

4) Then used another for loop to get the desired simulation table with if else condition in it.

5) Then used hist function to get the histogram for i_time(interarrival time).
