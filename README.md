# PD

1) I imported few library and modules such as numpy,random.

2) Created an empty list named i_time for interarrival time and another list a_time with an integer value 0 in it.

3) Used a for loop of range(20) to get a list of random value from 1 to 21.

4) Then used another for loop to get the desired simulation table with if else condition in it.

5) Then used hist function to get the histogram for i_time(interarrival time).
